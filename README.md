## Introduction

Foundation models represent a significant leap in machine learning. They allow developers to leverage pre-trained models for various tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and more. This repository showcases how to implement these models effectively within iOS and macOS applications.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Foundation Models Framework, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Xcode 14 or later**: This is essential for building iOS and macOS applications.
- **Swift 5.7 or later**: The examples are written in Swift, taking advantage of its modern features.

## Installation

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adhamtaha13/Foundation-Models-Framework-Example.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Foundation-Models-Framework-Example
```

## Usage

Once you have the repository set up, you can explore the example applications. Each app demonstrates different capabilities of the Foundation Models Framework.

### Running the Apps

To run the applications, open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode. Choose your target device (iOS simulator or macOS) and hit the Run button.

## Examples

Here are some key examples included in this repository:

### Text Classification

This example demonstrates how to use a foundation model for text classification. The app takes user input and classifies it into predefined categories.

### Image Recognition

In this example, the app uses a foundation model to identify objects in images. Users can upload images, and the app will display the recognized objects.

### Sentiment Analysis

This example shows how to analyze the sentiment of user-generated text. The app provides feedback on whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.
